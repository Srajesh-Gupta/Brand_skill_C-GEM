# C-GEM Brand Skill

C-GEM is India's only non-profit accountability partner for smallholder farming communities in carbon and ecosystem markets. It represents growers only — never a programme developer, buyer, or implementer. **Every artefact generated must read and look like it came from an organisation that has taken a moral position.**

> Positioning: **People-centric · Tech-enabled · Planetary-scale**
> Voice: **"Farmers First · Climate Always"**

---

## Quick-start decision tree

1. **Who reads this first?**
   - Farmer, FPO officer, CSO partner, journalist, funder → **Marketing skin** (default)
   - Carbon buyer, auditor, regulator, technical reviewer → **Platform skin** (add `.platform-skin` to root)
   - Mixed audience → Marketing skin with platform-style data tables embedded

2. **What format?** → See `templates/` for ready-to-use HTML starters.

3. **Need assets?** → Logos, brushmark, illustrations, photography all referenced in `assets/` and `references/assets.md`.

4. **Generating copy?** → Read `references/voice.md` before writing a single word.

## Identity — exact strings (non-negotiable)

| String | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Brand | `C-GEM` — hyphenated, ALL CAPS, always |
| Full name | `Centre for Grower-centric Eco-value Mechanisms` |
| Legal entity | `Eco-Value Empowerment Foundation` (statutory contexts only) |
| Programme 1 | `Carbon Ready™` |
| Programme 2 | `Carbon Bridge™` |
| Programme 3 | `Climate Learn™` |
| Programme 4 | `Beyond Carbon™` |

Programme names always carry the ™. Never drop it.

## Two skins, one core

Both skins share: pure white ground, brushmark C (real PNG asset — never a CSS text approximation), leaf green primary, Indian numerals (tabular), triplet rhythm.

```

## Typography (full reference in `references/typography.md`)

**Scale:** display `clamp(48px,6.5vw,96px)` · h1 `clamp(36px,4.5vw,64px)` · h2 `clamp(30px,3.6vw,48px)` · h3 24px · h4 20px · lede 18px · body 16px · small 14px · micro 12px · mono 11px

Headings: weight 500, line-height 1.05, tracking −0.025em to −0.035em. Body: line-height 1.5–1.65.

**Numerals:** Indian grouping always (`2,71,000` never `271,000`). `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on every stat or data column.

**Devanagari moments:** `font-family: var(--font-devanagari)` for Hindi, weight 600. Pair with Newsreader Italic emphasis.

---

## Type roles — use these CSS classes

```
.voice       Newsreader italic, leaf-700. Community quotes, ledes, emphasis.
             Platform: mono caps instead.
.triplet     Signature rhythm. Mono caps, green dots. "Farmers First · Climate Always"
.stat        Big tabular-num figure. Include <span class="unit"> child.
             .unit must use `font-size: clamp(11px, 0.32em, 18px)` — never bare `0.32em`.
.eyebrow     Mono 11px caps, 0.12em tracking, leaf-600. Section labels ONLY.
.hl          Sprout/lime inline highlight on emphasis word.
.lede        18px intro paragraph, max-width 60ch.
.footnote    10.5px mono caps, ink-faint.
.attribution Same as footnote.
.mono        Code chip on --paper-card.
.deva        Devanagari helper, weight 600.
.brushmark-bg  Brushmark backdrop on a section — use `assets/logo-brushmark.png` as `background-image`, never a CSS text "C" or SVG path approximation. Opacity by role: 6–10% as a hero/section watermark (`.brushmark-bg` helper defaults to 7%); up to 12–14% as a centred voice anchor on a paper-tonal cover section. The real asset is at `d:\Antigravity Projects\Branding\assets\logo-brushmark.png`; in HTML use a relative path `../../../assets/logo-brushmark.png` or embed as base64 if the file will be opened standalone.
```

**Geist Mono discipline — critical:** Geist Mono is a precision instrument, not wallpaper. Overusing it (eyebrows on every section, all stat units, all footnotes, all chips, the triplet, the CTA label) makes the output read as generic AI-generated design. Use it for: `.eyebrow` section labels, `.stat` figures, `.triplet` signature lines, `.footnote`/`.attribution` meta. Do NOT use it for: body copy, sub-headings, button labels, card descriptions, or any text a reader actually reads for meaning. If in doubt, use Geist (the display/body font) instead. The contrast between Newsreader Italic (warm, human) and Geist Mono (precise, functional) is what makes the brand feel intelligent — not the mono font itself.

**Buttons:** `.btn--primary` (ink bg → leaf-800 hover) · `.btn--secondary` (outlined) · `.btn--leaf` · `.btn--ghost`

**Components:** `.chip` · `.chip--leaf` · `.card` · `.card--ink` · `.index-list`

## Logo rules

Assets in `assets/logos/` — horizontal, stacked, logomark variants in black/white/inverse/full-colour.

- **Clear space:** half the cap-height of "C-GEM" on all sides minimum
- **Never** recolour the brushmark arc
- **Never** substitute the brushmark with a CSS text character, SVG arc, or ::before pseudo-element — always use `assets/logo-brushmark.png`
- **Never** place Full Colour on coloured, patterned, or photographic backgrounds — use White or Inverse there
- **Never** crop, stretch, skew, or rotate
- **Minimum:** 80px wide (digital), 18mm (print)
- Brushmark C, three sanctioned modes: hero/section watermark (6–10% opacity), centred voice anchor (up to 12–14% on paper-tonal), inline cap-height nav mark — always green, never recoloured or cropped

---

## Photography & illustration

Photography in `assets/photography/`, illustrations in `assets/illustrations/`.

- Documentary, warm-graded, agricultural. Farmers as protagonists — not scenery.
- Natural light, warm-neutral tones. No heavy filters, no blue grading.
- Text on photos: dark scrim ≤55% opacity. Never a solid colour block.
- When no photo available: `repeating-linear-gradient` placeholder with mono caption.
- Never: posed portraits, abstract nature shots, AI-generated landscapes, corporate stock.

## Pre-delivery checklist

Before finishing any artefact, verify every item:

1. Skin chosen by first reader? White ground only?
2. All numerals Indian-format? Tabular figures where numeric?
3. "Beneficiary/beneficiaries" absent? Hype words absent? Emoji absent?
4. Programme names carry ™? Brand strings exact?
5. Colours from token list — accents semantic, not decorative?
6. Voice moments in Newsreader Italic (or mono caps in platform skin)?
7. Logo on clean ground with clear space, ≥80px?
8. Sky `#3A5FA8` only on EEF statutory stamp — nowhere else?
9. Brushmark is `assets/logo-brushmark.png` (not a CSS text char or SVG arc) at a sanctioned opacity — 6–10% watermark, up to 12–14% only as a centred voice anchor?
10. Geist Mono used sparingly (labels, stats, meta only) — not on body copy or button text?
11. Copy contains no "no stake in credits" or similar language about C-GEM's financial position in the market?
